[Plugin] Browse The Web

Hi there,

yes I know there are other webbrowser plugins as well, but I found both of them have their advantages but I missed some features.
Also I like to play with HTML and web content so I started to biuld my own webbrowser.

Anyhow I like the design of the GeckoBrowser browsing by ID. Also I a fan of fullscreen action. And of course we need bookmarks...
So because of missing features I started to play arround. Very interessting is the Skybound.Gecko engine. I just add the zoom function
and ScrollTo funtion to the interface and this works great.

So what is this plugin for ? Browse the web and have fun !

Features:

Set homepage / blank screen
Edit/Save bookmarks in the setup
Save bookmark inside the MP
Zomm in/out
Move the window in all direction
Set font / zoom size in setup
Rename the plugin
Alternate OSD to show selected link ID
Optional show staus bar on bottom

Keyboard / Remote layout:

Keyboard	Remote		Function
------------------------------------------------
P		Play		select a url
B		Stop		blank page
Space		Pause		home page
0-9		0-9		Select a link ID
U		#		confirm link ID
Page up		P+		zoom out
Page down	P-		zoom in
F7		Step backw	go backward
F8		Step forw.	go forward
F9		Yellow		show favorites
R		Rec		add bookmark
up		up		move up
down		down		move down
left		left		move left
right		right		move right
ESC		ESC		leave plugin
M		Mute		toggle mute
X		Red		toggle statusbar

Thanks goes to the authors from the other plugins for many ideas.
This is also using the xulrunner engine.

Cheers
